// This gradient route code was inspired by but also modified from this Stack Overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5682688/gradient-polyline-with-mapkit-ios
// My modifications: instead of specifying a static max/min velocity for determining the hue of the gradient, we are doing extra work to determine the min/max velocity values in the CLLocation array
// so that whatever route you are looking at - the speed is relative to itself. With the static values - a walk will show up all red, and a run will show up all green, we really want to compare it against itself
// when making these assumptions about how fast you are going. Also - instead of doing a bunch of checks (the example I based this off of on Stack Overflow was doing a ton of if vmax... else blah blah blah)
// We can make this code better by making color a function of where the velocity falls in the range between the min/max velocities of the entire route.
// Other updates! Instead of drawing gradient path between every single point - we instead draw lines between every 10th
// (maybe this should be a funciton of the zoom level of the map?) point and use the middle point in between the start and
// end of the path as a control for a Bezier curve (this let's us 'fake' the curve a user would have followed to get from
// point a to b without us actually having to draw all of that data on the map - really speeds things up)
